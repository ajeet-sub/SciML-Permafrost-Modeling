# SciML-Permafrost-Modeling
## Description
The following is our code to compute the results for our PINN approach to predict the MAGT and ALT of permafrost. To run the PINN, refer to the PINN_Test.py script, which consists of the training script for the PINN and images of the plots. The GIPL baseline plots are in its own directory as well.
